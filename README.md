# InfoRetrieval
Assignments showcasing Information Retrieval system 


A1 : This project involves building a basic Information Retrieval (IR) system using Python and NLTK. It includes steps like text preprocessing (tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization), creating an inverted index, and implementing TF-IDF-based document ranking to return relevant search results for user queries. The system is evaluated using query results and designed to simulate how search engines retrieve and rank documents.

A2 : This assignment presents the implementation and evaluation of a neural information retrieval system using BERT and the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE). I compared these models against a BM25-based retrieval baseline from the previous assignment. After preprocessing and embedding queries and documents, the models ranked document relevance using cosine similarity. Results for sample queries were evaluated, and while neural methods showed promise, BM25 surprisingly outperformed them in MAP and P@10 scores.
